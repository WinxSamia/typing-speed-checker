Q2. Difference between global scope and block scope
Ans:If any varibale or constant declared in global scope, that variable can be accessed from
any scope but a variable or constant declared in block scope, that is accessed only from that
particular block.


Q3.How JS eventloop works
Ans:The event loop is a process that waits for the Call Stack to be clear before pushing callbacks
from the Task Queue to the Call Stack. Once the Stack is clear, the event loop triggers and checks the Task Queue for
available callbacks.
If there are any, it pushes it to the Call Stack, waits for the Call Stack to be clear again, and repeats the same
process.
