Q3.How JS eventloop works
Ans:The event loop is a process that waits for the Call Stack to be clear before pushing callbacks
from the Task Queue to the Call Stack. Once the Stack is clear, the event loop triggers and checks the Task Queue for
available callbacks.
If there are any, it pushes it to the Call Stack, waits for the Call Stack to be clear again, and repeats the same
process.

3. When the property is not into the object,
4. When the index of array does not exists
5. When we call an array like an object
